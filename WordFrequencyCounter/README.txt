Word Frequency Counter

This is a program that reads a text file and counts the number of times each word appears and
outputs words that are used more often than some threshold value given by the user.
It outputs only words that are not the 100 most commonly used words.
Program is tried on the included text files which were downloaded from Project Guten-bergâ€™s 
public domain e-book archive http://www.gutenberg.org/.

Here is an example output that we can see in our program :
